A brief description of each of the experiments is provided, in the readme of their parent subfolders {tuning or testing}, along with the information describing the essential subprocess with relevant code scripts used by pipeline version of that experiment.  
Code that will process patients and execute the particular flavor of the pipeline can be found in ./experiments/subfolder {tuning/testing}/experiment_name/.  
To execute it on tuning/testing patients, run script **./experiments/subfolder {tuning/testing}/experiment_name/main.py**
